## 🚀 About Me

- 🗺️ I'm a mapping surveyor of [Badan Informasi Geospasial](https://big.go.id), a geospatial authority in Indonesia.
- 🛰️ I have an interest on improving Satellite-Derived Bathymetry for shallow water mapping.
- 🎓 I'm looking for a master's scholarship that would support the research on improving Satellite-Derived Bathymetry for a faster shallow water mapping in Indonesia's remote areas.
